### [STREAMLIT APP](https://lbw-predictor.streamlit.app/)

### OVERVIEW
This is an AI-assistant trained on data routinely collected about pregnant women during their pregnancy and is easily accessible in their hospital records, EHR. This AI-assistant is designed to provide predictive assistance on some healthcare challenges facing pregnant women and women in general. It brings together three machine learning models to one place where doctors and midwives could easily access these functionalities and make timely predictions on maternal conditions such as Preterm Delivery, women giving birth to Low Birth Weight babies, and Pregnancy-related Diabetes. 


### THE BIG PICTURE 
As AI-assisted applications become widely common in the hospital setting, AI applications such as this, which can scan through the EHR of patients and flag or make predictions on a medical condition the doctor may have overlooked, or needs to pay extra attention to. In Ghana, where there is widespread burnout among medical doctors and other healthcare professions, such AI-assisted diagnosis could be very helpful in saving patient lives.

### METHODOLOGY
Ths is a streamlit application that uses machine learning models saved from previous data analysis workbooks to build its AI-assistant.
